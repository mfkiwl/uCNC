_ÂµCNC for NXP LPC176x can be built this way_

## Method one - PlatformIO (preferred)

1. Get [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it.
2. Install the PlatformIO extension.
3. Open uCNC folder in VSCode.
4. Edit ```cnc_config.h file``` and ```cnc_hal_config.h file``` to fit your needs and board.
5. If needed edit the platformio.ini file environment for your board. Compile the sketch and upload it to your board or sdcard if your board firmware is loaded this way.
