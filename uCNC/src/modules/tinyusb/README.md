# µCNC and tinyUSB
µCNC uses [tinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) to provide the stackframe to use the USB port (if the MCU has one) as a virtual COM port

## How to use tinyUSB
The modified/slimmed version of [tinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) is included in µCNC so nothing needs to be done. Currently v0.12.0 of tinyUSB is being used.
